# octimemos

Simple memos with fast flow.

- Always available input field for fast memo adding.
- ~~Swipes for edit (swipe to right) and remove (swipe to left).~~
  - because of the swipes it was easy to messed up and delete while you scroll through, for now for additional actions - long tap on a note.
- Persistent data with sqlite.
- Simple look.
